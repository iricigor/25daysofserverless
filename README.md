## Introduction

Now that it's December, the whole world is trying to relax and get ready for varied and diverse holiday traditions with family and friends. But something horrible has happened! An evil grinch has stolen the world's servers, making it harder for people to use technology to ease their holiday stress.

Fortunately, you're on the case, and have serverless technology at your disposal! We'll need you to spend the month of December traveling to different places all across the world, helping different people make sure they can continue their holiday traditions.

Each day between now and December 25 will bring a new problem to solve using serverless technology. Solve it in the programming language of your choice and submit your solution via GitHub. We'll showcase the best solutions every week and possibly in a final series recap!

What are you waiting for? Let's go save the holidays!
